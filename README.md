# Supply Chain Analysis
Overview
This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of a supply chain dataset to uncover insights and trends. Leveraging Python and popular data analysis libraries, the analysis encompasses various aspects of the supply chain, including sales, revenue, defects, manufacturing costs, and transportation modes.

# Key Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Insightful Visualizations: Utilized Seaborn and Matplotlib to create dynamic and static visualizations for better comprehension.
SKU-level Analysis: Investigated revenue, stock levels, and order quantities at a granular SKU level.
Defect Rates Analysis:Explored defect rates across different product types and transportation modes.
Average Lead Time and Manufacturing Costs: Calculated and presented the average lead time and manufacturing costs by product type.

# Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language for data analysis.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization.


# Data
The dataset (supply_chain_data.csv) contains information on product types, prices, revenue generated, number of products sold, lead time, manufacturing costs, stock levels, order quantities, shipping carriers, shipping costs, transportation modes, SKU, and defect rates.

# Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the supply chain, aiding in decision-making and process optimization. Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and findings.
